# Grid-Challenge
### Problem Overview 

>In an 'n' x 'n' grid, find the largest product of four consecutive numbers. In this context, consecutive numbers are 
> next to each other either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. For example a product from the numbers in row 18, 
> column 15, to row 15, column 18 equaling 93128300 

Looking at the provided challenge question and googling around a bit, it seems to be based on version of a problem made 
famous by [Project Euler's Problem 11](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11). <i>Project Euler</i> is a site dedicated to 
challenging mathematical and computational programming problems attempting to teach skills outside <i>just</i> pure
logical insight - to teach new and unfamiliar concepts through stringent challenges and problem-solving ('game-y-fied', 
as it were). At face value, it seems to try to test the following:

* 2D array traversal 
* Loop control logic 
* Bounds-safe indexing

All of which should be a fun, ( <i>maybe not fun, but interesting</i>) task to try and solve. As a 'DSA challenge', I'll 
try and strive to solve the task while emphasizing the importance of building a correct / functioning and readable 
solution before iterating into optimization. To
